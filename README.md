# Node REST API

This repository contains a REST API project built using Express.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. The project is focused on practicing core RDBMS concepts, the fundamentals of creating a RESTful API, and API testing using Postman. The project includes CRUD operations.

## Technologies

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js** - Minimalist web framework for Node.js to manage routing and middleware.
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database system for handling data persistence.
- **Postman** - API client used to test, monitor, and document API endpoints.
- **SQL Shell (`psql`)** - Command-line interface for interacting with PostgreSQL databases.

## Features

- Routing concepts and structuring routes in an Express.js application.
- Creating and managing a PostgreSQL database using the `psql` shell.
- Performing SQL queries directly on the PostgreSQL database.
- Utilizing Postman to test the API endpoints and validate responses.
- Understanding and implementing callback functions for asynchronous operations.

## SQL Shell Setup

To interact with your PostgreSQL database using the SQL shell (`psql`), follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Start the `psql` shell by typing:
   ```sh
   psql -U your_username -d your_database
   ```
